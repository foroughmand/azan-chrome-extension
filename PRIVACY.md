Azan – Prayer Times Extension

Last updated: November 2025

This Chrome extension does *not collect, store, or share any personal data*.

## Information Collection

The extension operates entirely within your browser. It does not send any data to external servers or third parties.
It uses the following local data sources:
- `chrome.storage.sync` — to store your selected city and calculation method.
These are stored locally on your device and optionally synchronized with your Google account through Chrome Sync (Google’s standard browser feature).
- `praytime.js` — used for local calculation of prayer times.
All calculations happen entirely on your device.

## Information Sharing

No data is transmitted outside your browser.

The extension does not use any analytics, tracking scripts, cookies, or external APIs.

## Permissions

The extension requests minimal permissions:
- storage: to save user preferences.
- alarms: to update prayer times periodically in the background.

## Third Parties

No third-party services are used for data processing or tracking.
The extension’s source code is open and available at:
